I have no plans to continue working on Bane.  If you want to take it over, feel free to contact me and it's yours.

Bane
====

Bane is a simple client for the Tox instant messaging network.  It should work on MacOS X 10.6 or greater

Download the code and use XCode to build it.  At the moment there are no binaries available.
